Neural Networks

Algorith is code
Model is output outcome of Algorithm



M/C vs Deep 
-> M/C -> You will be able to interpret the data and able to define.,


-> (Deep) Dump data to alg and let alg do all stuff.
-> (Deep) comes with cost -> Based on Alg -> Knowlegde on what Alg is, and what would be outcome.
-> Deep is black box we cannot interpret what would be the number and will be in numbers
-> In deep learning is not a Algorithm., It is based on Neural Network neurons;
	Deep learning should be performed on huge data. which is not manageable by other tool.
-> Deep learning will give acurray similar 

More data more experiance..., but saturates at a upperlimit.

But in Deep learning -> Has no upperlimit.. it is hungry of data..
example -- Alexa, IBM watson


IBM Watson - Scans if human has a tumor or not based on pattern available and image color/texture.. which more accurate.


Deep learning can only be done an a heavy processing computers. not on personal pc's
Can be done on cloud/GPU nodes.

Predictive analysis:

Examples: Loan Payment prediction and customre credit policy analysis
Automated trading systems
Credit scoring -- CIBIL score
RisK Management
Fraud Detection
Classification and clustering customers based on trading targeted market
Collection analytics -> understand history of default customer history.

What is learning?
--------------------
Learn from Experiance

(( What are you intending to achieve? what is final outcome?

Keywords :
1)Task:
	--> Classification - (Supervised Learning)
		- Figuring out based on know pattern example image of a cat or dog
		Binary Classification --(Two classes -> weather yes or not/true or false/genuine or not/ possible or not possible)
			(Buy/Sell/Hold - Model)
			If you have no idea how many class you have in your data this is a problem, but it is possible.
			Example: Customer Retaintion (iteration analysis)
		different example:
		Climate conditions weather it will rain or not


		Multi Classification-- ( More than one class)
			Financial instutions  
			-> Technical Analysis & Fundamental Analysis
				Fundamental Analysis --what type of company it is -> how much revenue is generated.. what all market is it covering
						-- 360 view of the company when it has ups and downs..
				Technical Analysis  -- Is Kind of IntraDay Analysis
		
	--> Regression -- (Supervised Learning)
		Predicted number is Regression
		
	--> Clustoring -- (Unsupervised Learning) If i have no y axis to define
		example :I have 2 folders with cat and dog in separate folders.Made machine to understand based on category male or female,
				how they look made it learn based on cluster/category
				Made machine to learn it and then mixed folder, Machine should be able to cluster based on the pattern.

		Pathology labs- does heat map on patiences to detect type of epidemic on dailybases
		Clustoring the whole geographical data and finding the solution
		
		Rating False Positive or False Negative of the illness and mark it weather serious or not if only 99.9 % accurate.
		
		
		example - Customer visiting store/Bank we dont have pattern purpose they have come but we can make algorithm run based on pattern and decide use case by clustering based on pattern.
Note : Clustering is not always qualitative 
		example - Dimensionality Reduction - Big matrix reducing into a smaller one.
		

2)Experiance
Learning comes from experiance--> that means on Data --> More data you have i.e. history more accurtae data is.


3)Performance 





Supervised Learning vs Unsupervised Learning:
---------------------------------------------

Supervised Learning <-- Both inputs and outputs goes hand in hand in Algorithm,. and gives you accuracy.

SemiSupervised Learning --> Have lables for some data and have no lables for some data
	We will run model for lables and then run for the one's that are not having lable. we dont directly start clustering.
Unsupervised Learning <-- U just have inputs but not output
Usecases: 
--Outliers
--Anomaly Detection -
		Fraud Detection -- No one dont know how does Fraud looks like in the form of transcation

	Once the pattern is detected over time the unsupervised data starts get labelled and supervised.

	


Why do people generate data?

OverFitting in ML - How to avoid that
--------------------------------------
When it mugs up the data which is seen, and gives output without runing algorithm
Training error is small and Cross validation is very low, and testing error is very high then it is overfiting
Works only unseen data.
