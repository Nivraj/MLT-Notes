**Feature selection :**
Feature engineering for ML - Generating new features out of existing feature.
examples - Sales data based on Month dimension and providing a stastic based on customer behavior and provide offers 
      -- Parts of speech ( features generating from the sentance based upon text)

Overtime we create more features for value add. and once we get the feature we are looking for we start reducing feature.

  Topic - Feature Selection- In python 'their is default fuction that creates 10 different feature based on algorithm
  example - chi-square test/Z test /F test


Hypothesis - telling this feature is important
Null hypothesis - this says no Feature is important
