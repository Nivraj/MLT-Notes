Systematic Workflow process of Machine Learning
------------------------------------------------
1. Access and load data
2. Process Data Flow ---> Data cleaning + Scale( Min Max Scaling) + Standarisation + Binarization
3. Derive feature based on processed data
4. Train Model 
5. choose the best suitable model
6. deploy best model and generate output


Job of Machine Learning: To find best Fit value with minimum error
SDG** (look google for referance) 

Formula --> y = mx + c 
ML --> y= w0 + w1   --> we need to find what is w0 and w1 not the formula.
We need to see only w0 & w1.

If i add a quadratic equation 
formula --> y= mx + c +x2
ML --> w0 +w2+w32

Interns we went from linear regression to polynomial regression.


Note: Linear regression or Polymomial regression depends on inputs leading to multi variant linear regression or Multi polynomial regression

Non parametric Algorithm - Algorithms which do not learn on functional firm, Machine learns entire set of all parameters ( it may learn 2 or 20)

support algorithms:
Navie base Regression algorithm
Support vector regression
Desicion tree
Logistic Regression
LDA - Linear Discriminat Algorithm

** Tolerance comes into picture when Algorithm is always yielding wrong predictions just limit the threshold and exit from the iteration




TF-IDF - Term frequency vs inversed Document frequency --> Used for Sentement Analysis.
Edge detection
AHC
SDG process - iterative process of loading data in machine learning algorith
CLAHC
Noise Reduction 
High pass filter/low pass filter




**Feature selection :**
Feature engineering for ML - Generating new features out of existing feature.
examples - Sales data based on Month dimension and providing a stastic based on customer behavior and provide offers 
      -- Parts of speech ( features generating from the sentance based upon text)

Overtime we create more features for value add. and once we get the feature we are looking for we start reducing feature.

  Topic - Feature Selection- In python 'their is default fuction that creates 10 different feature based on algorithm
  example - chi-square test/Z test /F test


Hypothesis - telling this feature is important
Null hypothesis - this says no Feature is important
