Loss function 
First order condition(derivative) of the loss  fuction should be zero
1. Sum of Errors
2. Royle's theorem : 
  It has to be continues
  Its RHL and LHL should be available 
  and RHL=LHL should be equal
  
  This absolute fuction is not differentiable. 
3. Sum of squares of Errors:


OLS - Ordinary least square. solution is a closed form solution
Derivate of loss function
